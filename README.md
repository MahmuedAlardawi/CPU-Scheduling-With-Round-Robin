# CPU-Scheduling-With-Round-Robin
King AbdulAziz Universality - Operating Systems (CPCS-361)

## Project Overview

This project is part of the CPCS-302 course. The goal is to design and implement a simulator that models job scheduling and CPU scheduling behaviors of an operating system, focusing on handling job arrivals, process creation, memory and device allocation, and process execution using a Dynamic Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

## Features

- Simulates job scheduling and CPU scheduling based on given specifications.
- Utilizes Dynamic Round Robin for process scheduling.
- Supports job rejection based on memory and device availability.
- Implements priority-based job queue management.
- Provides detailed output of the system's state at any given time.
